# bikesharing

The main objective of the exercise is to analyze mobility by bicycle in NYC. A difference has been made between the genres and the days when this means of transport is most used.

In the first analysis, it is seen that men are the ones who use the bicycle the longest, unlike women.

We also saw that Thursdays from 5 to 6 pm is when there is a higher concentration of bicycle users in the Big Apple.

And that of these users, the majority are men, as for women, they also use it more frequently but it is a smaller number.

And finally, for the most part, the type of user who uses the bicycle on Thursdays are men who have a subscription.

as a curious fact, women are the ones who start trips more in Manhattan than in other parts of NYC.
